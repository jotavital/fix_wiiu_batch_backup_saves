# fix_wiiu_batch_backup_saves

This script is useful if you made a batch backup of your Wii U games using saveMii mod, and they were saved to a folder structure that saveMii mod doesn't seem to resolve when
you try to restore your saves.

# Basic usage
When you open the program you're gonna need to provide the full absolute path to your batch backup saves. Example: D:\Downloads\Jogos\Wii U\backups jogos\2022-01-29T100416. (without slash at the end).
And also gonna need to provide the slot number to wich you want to restore your saves, example: 0, 45, 255...
And done, the program will show a report at the end, for you to know if it has sucessfully done its mission.

# Warning
I developed this in like 30 minutes, without strong knownledge of Python language. So make a backup of the backup of your saves for don't having any problems.

# that's it
